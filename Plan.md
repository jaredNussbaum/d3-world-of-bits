# D3: horse

# Game Design Vision

In this project we willbe making a game where players can scroll their neighborhood and find farm animals to merge with other similar farm animals. Doing this will earn the player points and create cooler farm animals.

# Technologies

- TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
- Deno and Vite for building
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation

# Assignments

## D3.a: Core mechanics (token collection and crafting)

- Add: Core gameplay mechanics: Merging, full map generation, caches with specific 2048-inspired value

## D3.b

- Add: Extra gameplay elements: Player movement, dynamic cache spawning, cache refreshing, and a win condition

## D3.c

- Add: Memory system for caches: When the camera moves away from caches, make sure they remain in whatever state they were in when the camera left, reload that state when the camera returns

## D3.d

- Add: Geolocational movement, save/load functionality, options tab to restart the game, or swap between button-based and geolocational movement

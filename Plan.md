# Game Design Vision

In this project we willbe making a game where players can scroll their neighborhood and find farm animals to merge with other similar farm animals. Doing this will earn the player points and create cooler farm animals.

# Technologies

- TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
- Deno and Vite for building
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation

# Assignments
